# MySQL

There are no challenges in this folder. The MySQL scripts here are used to bootstrap the mysql instance with data. You are not expected to change anything here.

The database used is from https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db.

Use `docker-compose up -d --build mysql` to build and boot the mysql instance and make it accessible from `localhost:13306`. Username is `root` and password is `verysecurerootpasswordiclassTECHtessolution12345672019docker`. You can also access through PhpMyAdmin through `http://localhost:18080`
